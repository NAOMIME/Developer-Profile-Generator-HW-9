#Naomies ReadMe Generator

---

## Description

Readmes are a very important partof every github repository as it enables the projects propective contributors to easily understand the context of the project whose repository they're cloning. Creating this particular project information and context description containment file can be daunting at at times, making the repository's dictators lazy to do so, even though the process is a neccessity. In order to automate the process of creating the Readme files I decided to build a node.js prompt runner with Enquirer prompt that takes the users inputs for the various standard projects description parameters in order to create at least the starter Readme.md file for the github repositories. This readme gen is also capable of making axios http calls to github to get the user's github profile picture and badge to be added to the Readme file
